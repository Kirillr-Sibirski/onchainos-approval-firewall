# PermissionGuard

`PermissionGuard` is an agent-native approval firewall for X Layer wallets.

It turns raw OKX OnchainOS approval primitives into a reusable operator tool that can:

- inspect ERC-20 approval exposure
- score approval health under opinionated policy presets
- enforce local spender budgets from a policy file
- replace unlimited approvals with exact allowances
- emit markdown and JSON artifacts for auditability
- log every live remediation run to a local audit trail

## Why it matters

Most agents can trade, but very few can manage their permissions safely.

PermissionGuard is built for the missing agent-ops layer:

- unlimited approvals should not linger after execution
- trusted spenders still need spend budgets
- risky or blocked spenders should be removed automatically
- every cleanup should leave behind an artifact a human can review

This is the core thesis for the OKX Build X Hackathon submission: `agents need a permission firewall, not just a revoke button`.

## Product Surface

The CLI now includes:

- `status`: one-screen wallet health summary and next action
- `inspect`: raw approval inventory for a wallet
- `plan`: policy-driven decisions for each approval
- `report`: markdown or JSON submission artifact
- `execute`: live cleanup and exact-allowance remediation
- `audit`: local execution history with artifact and tx references

## Live-Proven Flows

The current build has been tested live on X Layer with an Agentic Wallet.

Proven transactions:

- setup unlimited approval: `0x23423ae4622271d62070c356305e06b803d62cb486aca426ff0aa2b399b69481`
- revoke unlimited approval: `0x1e02d66dd26b2a85305e91771cd261e314e80c5407c507a745d91fbcba586d33`
- cleanup leg of exact remediation: `0x4d32af6447c64bb6fc8cda31a2779a6f3912a7450401e7ff17c9281c18968fb4`
- exact regrant leg of exact remediation: `0x8e675c89d98ecf38ebe5525514c60d513d4cd173f569652b85919326c7d445cf`

The successful exact-remediation run wrote a local audit artifact to:

- `.permission-guard/runs/2026-04-12T16-47-55-954Z-execute.json`

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- `onchainos` CLI installed and authenticated
- Agentic Wallet access for live execution

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Use the sample policy file as a starting point:

```bash
cp permission-guard.policy.example.json permission-guard.policy.json
```

Check wallet health:

```bash
npm run dev -- status --address 0xYourWallet --policy strict --config permission-guard.policy.json
```

Inspect approvals:

```bash
npm run dev -- inspect --address 0xYourWallet --chain xlayer
```

Generate a policy plan:

```bash
npm run dev -- plan --address 0xYourWallet --policy strict --config permission-guard.policy.json
```

Write a markdown report artifact:

```bash
npm run dev -- report --address 0xYourWallet --policy strict --config permission-guard.policy.json --output .permission-guard/report.md
```

Preview live cleanup:

```bash
npm run dev -- execute --address 0xYourWallet --policy strict --config permission-guard.policy.json
```

Apply live cleanup and exact remediation:

```bash
npm run dev -- execute --address 0xYourWallet --policy strict --config permission-guard.policy.json --apply
```

Review recent live runs:

```bash
npm run dev -- audit
```

## Policy-As-Code

PermissionGuard supports a local JSON policy file for spender-specific rules.

Example:

```json
{
  "defaults": {
    "chain": "xlayer",
    "policy": "strict"
  },
  "spenders": {
    "0x8b773d83bc66be128c60e07e17c8901f7a64f000": {
      "label": "Execution Router",
      "trust": "trusted",
      "maxAllowance": "500000",
      "exactAllowance": "250000",
      "notes": [
        "Cap router spend to the smallest amount that still lets the agent execute."
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Supported spender controls:

- `trust: trusted` for approved operators with a spend budget
- `trust: watchlist` for spenders that should stay visible in reviews
- `trust: blocked` for immediate revocation
- `maxAllowance` for budget enforcement
- `exactAllowance` for exact regrant after cleanup
- `notes` for operator context in plan and report output

## Demo Story

The strongest live demo is:

1. Run `status` to show the wallet health summary.
2. Run `plan` to show a local policy catching an unlimited approval.
3. Run `report --output ...` to create a polished artifact.
4. Run `execute --apply` to revoke the unlimited approval and regrant an exact budget.
5. Run `audit` to show the recorded cleanup and tx hashes.

## Notes

- The tool currently targets ERC-20 approvals first.
- Permit2 awareness is intentionally lightweight in this milestone.
- Approval budget values are expected in raw token units for now.
- Live execution uses `tx-scan` before contract calls and records the resulting artifact locally.
